# Make a Discord bot in Rust!

Discord bots are cool, right? Haven't you ever wanted to make your own?

Well, today we're going to do exactly that, but this time we're using Rust! We're going to build a Discord bot that allows you to setup polls, and updates counts in real-time!

For this tutorial, I do recommend an intermediate understanding of low-level concepts such as memory management, and some experience with Rust as well.

## Getting started

We're going to host our Discord bot on [repl.it](https://repl.it).

To get started, [create an account](https://repl.it/signup). I personally recommend you sign in with your GitHub account if you have one, but email is fine too.

Now let's create a new Rust project by clicking [this link](https://repl.it/languages/rust):

## Adding the library and setting up a basic bot

Right now, our Rust program isn't a Cargo project. That means it won't be able to import any libraries.

Let's fix that by running `cargo init --name polling-bot` in the terminal. You can replace `polling-bot` with whatever you want your program to be named. This should create two new files on the side: `.gitignore` and `Cargo.toml`, which we'll be using to add the Serenity library:

![New files created by cargo init](https://cloud-bxfulgo22.vercel.app/0image.png)

Next, create a new file called `real_main.rs` and put this code in it:
```rust
fn main() {
    // todo
}
```

Replace the contents of `main.rs` with this:
```rust
fn main() { std::process::Command::new("cargo").arg("run").status().unwrap(); }
```

This is kind of a hack but it's necessary to make sure that the environment variables are passed through correctly. You'll be doing all your coding in `real_main.rs`.

One last thing: Update the path to the source file in `Cargo.toml`, changing `main.rs` to `real_main.rs`. Your Cargo.toml should look like this:

### What is Serenity?

Serenity is a Rust _crate_ (or library) that helps you write Discord bots in Rust. If you've heard of Discord.py for Python, or Discord.js for JavaScript, you can kind of think of Serenity like that, except for Rust.

### Adding the bot token

Now, we need to create a new bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Click "New Application" in the top right corner, highlighted in red here:

![Discord Developer Portal- New Application](https://cloud-4fax6pert.vercel.app/0inkedscreenshot_2020-11-19_discord_developer_portal_____api_docs_for_bots_and_developers_li.jpg)

Give your bot a nice name (I'm using "Polling Bot" for this tutorial), then hit the create button!

Now, go to the "Bot" section of your application, highlighted in red here:

![Polling Bot- Bot section](https://cloud-jufkijale.vercel.app/0inkedscreenshot_2020-11-19_discord_developer_portal_____api_docs_for_bots_and_developers_1__li.jpg)

Click the "Add Bot" button to enable the bot for this application, highlighted in red here:

![Polling Bot, bot section- Add Bot button](https://cloud-jdkfymmpt.vercel.app/0inkedscreenshot_2020-11-19_discord_developer_portal_____api_docs_for_bots_and_developers_2__li.jpg)

If you want to, feel free to rename the bot's username or give it an avatar. I'm skipping that here since it's up to you to add your own creative touch âœ¨

Alright, now that we've setup our bot, copy the bot's token by clicking the "Copy" button next to the token field, highlighted in light cyan here:

![Polling Bot, bot section- Copy button next to Token field](https://cloud-7f7l7crt1.vercel.app/0inkedscreenshot_2020-11-19_discord_developer_portal_____api_docs_for_bots_and_developers_3__li.jpg)

Great, you've copied your token!

Let's put it into Repl.it. Create a new `.env` file in Repl.it. The `.env` file is a special file that allows you to store secrets, such as your Discord bot's token, for example.

Inside the `.env` file, add a new line that looks like `DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>`. Replace `<token>` with the token that you previously copied. It should look like this (I've redacted my token):

![.env file with DISCORD_TOKEN variable set to your token](https://cloud-nn0n8t195.vercel.app/0inkedscreenshot_2020-11-19_fluffyprevailingmarketing_li.jpg)

Now, let's add the Serenity library! Head over to `Cargo.toml` and add this line under your `[dependencies]` section: `serenity = "0.9.1"`. At the time of writing, the latest version of Serenity is 0.9.1, but you can replace it with the latest version which can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/serenity).

We'll also need another helper library, `tokio`. Add `tokio = { version = "^0.2.23", features = ["macros"] }` to your `Cargo.toml` as well. This library just helps us out with some async stuff, but you don't need to worry too much about it for now. Don't use the latest version of Tokio (0.3 or later) as this will cause incompatibilities with Serenity!

Your `Cargo.toml` should now look like this:

![Cargo.toml with Serenity dependency](https://cloud-epv4dnmyn.vercel.app/0image.png)

Now, let's add a basic Discord bot template. At this point, you should have invited your bot to a server for testing.

Delete the contents of `real_main.rs` and replace it with this:
```rust
use serenity::async_trait;
use serenity::framework::standard::{
    macros::{command, group},
    Args, CommandResult, StandardFramework,
};
use serenity::model::{
    channel::{Message, Reaction},
    gateway::Ready,
};
use serenity::prelude::*;

struct Handler;

#[async_trait]
impl EventHandler for Handler {
    async fn ready(&self, _: Context, ready: Ready) {
        println!("Bot ready with username {}", ready.user.name);
    }
}

#[group]
#[commands(ping)]
struct General;

#[command]
async fn ping(ctx: &Context, msg: &Message, mut _args: Args) -> CommandResult {
    msg.channel_id.say(&ctx.http, "Pong!").await?;

    Ok(())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let token = std::env::var("DISCORD_TOKEN").expect("Expected DISCORD_TOKEN to be set!");

    let framework = StandardFramework::new()
        .configure(|c| c.case_insensitivity(true))
        .group(&GENERAL_GROUP);

    let mut client = Client::builder(&token)
        .event_handler(Handler)
        .framework(framework)
        .await
        .expect("Failed to build client");

    if let Err(why) = client.start().await {
        println!("Client error: {:?}", why);
    }
}
```

This is just a super simple template that has a `~ping` command which makes the bot respond with `Pong!`.

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

```rust
use serenity::async_trait;
use serenity::framework::standard::{
    macros::{command, group},
    Args, CommandResult, StandardFramework,
};
use serenity::model::{
    channel::{Message, Reaction},
    gateway::Ready,
};
use serenity::prelude::*;
```
These are just some imports that we need.

```rust
struct Handler;
```
This creates a new type called `Handler` which has no data. We're going to be implementing the `EventHandler` trait on it so that we can handle ready events.

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl EventHandler for Handler {
    async fn ready(&self, _: Context, ready: Ready) {
        println!("Bot ready with username {}", ready.user.name);
    }
}
```
This implements the `EventHandler` trait for `Handler`. By default all of the event handlers don't do anything, but here we override the `ready` method, so that we can print our bot's username once it's ready.

Since we're defining an `async fn` in the implementation, we have to use the `#[async_trait]` attribute (imported above) to allow it, because [currently Rust does not natively support async traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2739).

```rust
#[group]
#[commands(ping)]
struct General;
```
This sets up a command group. In Serenity, commands can only be added through command groups, so we just setup a `General` command group with the `ping` command.

```rust
#[command]
async fn ping(ctx: &Context, msg: &Message, mut _args: Args) -> CommandResult {
    msg.channel_id.say(&ctx.http, "Pong!").await?;

    Ok(())
}
```
This is the `ping` command. We just take the command's message, get the channel it was sent in, and send `Pong!` in that channel. (So, we just reply with `Pong!`.)

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let token = std::env::var("DISCORD_TOKEN").expect("Expected DISCORD_TOKEN to be set!");
```
This is the start of the main function. We mark it with the `#[tokio::main]` annotation to make it into an `async fn` which it is not by default.

Then, we retrieve the token from the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable and panic if it's not set.

```rust

    let framework = StandardFramework::new()
        .configure(|c| c.case_insensitivity(true))
        .group(&GENERAL_GROUP);
```
Here we setup the Serenity standard command framework. We configure it to allow case insensitivity, so that commands can be typed like `~poll`, `~pOlL`, `~poLL` or any other combination. Then we also add the `General` group of commands which includes the `ping` command we defined above.

```rust

    let mut client = Client::builder(&token)
        .event_handler(Handler)
        .framework(framework)
        .await
        .expect("Failed to build client");

    if let Err(why) = client.start().await {
        println!("Client error: {:?}", why);
    }
}
```
Now we setup our Discord bot client with the token we got earlier, our event handler (which prints the bot's username once the ready event is received), and our command framework.

Then, we start the bot, and if there's an error after running it, we print the error.

That's all of the details!

</details>

Run the bot to make sure that everything works. It may take a while to build at first but subsequent builds will be faster.

Now it's time to actually add polling to the bot!

## Creating a `poll` command

Let's create the `~poll` command which we'll use to actually setup polls.

Before we actually add the command though, we'll need to define some types to represent polls.

Add these lines to your imports:
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::Mutex;
```

This just imports some things we'll be using soon.

Now let's start adding the types for polls. Add this code before `struct General` in `real_main.rs`:
```rust
struct PollsKey;

impl TypeMapKey for PollsKey {
    type Value = Arc<Mutex<PollsMap>>;
}
```

Here, we create a new type `PollsKey` which we'll use to retrieve the current polls. We also implement the `TypeMapKey` trait for `PollsKey`, which lets us use it as a key in a type map. Serenity uses type maps for data storage so that's why we have to make this type. We set the type of the key's value to be `Arc<Mutex<PollsMap>>`. `Arc` is atomic reference-counting, which lets us share an object across threads (this is necessary for async). `Mutex` is used for exclusive access to the map, when we are changing it. `Arc<Mutex<...>>` is a common pattern used to share mutable data across threads.

Next, let's define the `PollsMap` type:
```rust
type PollsMap = HashMap<(ChannelId, MessageId), Poll>;
```

`PollsMap` is just a type alias to a `HashMap` with key type `(ChannelId, MessageId)` (a tuple) and value type `Poll`.

Finally, let's define the `Poll` type:
```rust
struct Poll {
    pub question: String,
    pub answers: Vec<String>,
    pub answerers: Vec<usize>,
}
```

The `Poll` type just has a question, list of answers and how many people answered for each response.
